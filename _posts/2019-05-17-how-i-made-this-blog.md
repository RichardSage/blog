After doing literally nothing for Two years with a Hugo blog on my sage.re domain, hosted on github pages i felt like it was time to do something different, in a way i found more usable to make it more likely for me to blog more. After looking around at various options including Wordpress i decided to go for Jekyll. S3 for hosting, Cloudfront for CDN and SSL, Route 53 for DNS and using Forestry.io as a CMS for Jekyll.

Once i've settled into using Forestry i'll write a new post covering the whole stack.
