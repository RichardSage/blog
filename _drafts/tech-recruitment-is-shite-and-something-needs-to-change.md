# The problem

Finding good Tech hires is both fundamentally important, difficult and expensive.

Relying on recruitment consultants/agencies/headhunters is expensive and the 'middle-people' often add limited value to the process, whilst taking a large percentage in reward. 

'Doing it yourself', tapping up your network, posting on your socials, social advertising (e.g. Linkedin), minimises the chances of diversity in your hires and means you potentially miss out on 'the one'. Doing it yourself via direct advertising on job boards is cheaper than using agencies but still expensive and you have to invest time in filtering out the wheat from the chaff.

# The Solution?

What if there was a free Tech job board that any company could post on direct?

What if you wanted to post on that board but didn't want to filter out the wheat from the chaff and could pay someone to do it for you?
